# Load Packages

You will need to have `genlasso`, `wavethresh` and `smashr` installed to run.
The first two are on CRAN.
The `smashr` package can be installed from github using the following code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("stephenslab/smashr")
```


```{r}
library(wavethresh)
library(genlasso)
library(smashr)
```

# Some Cell Cycle Data

The data come from a recent experiment performed in the Gilad lab by Po Tung, in collaboration with Joyce Hsiao and others. 
This was an early look at these data (later published in (https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/4/611)).


The data are measuring the activity of 10 genes that may or may not be involved in the "cell cycle", which is the process cells go through as
they divide. (We have data on a large number of genes, but Joyce has picked out 10 of them for us to look at.) Each gene is measured
in many single cells, and we have some independent (but noisy) measurement of where each cell is in the cell cycle.


```{r}
d = readRDS("../data/cyclegenes.rds")
dim(d)
```

Here each row is a single cell. The first column ("theta") is an estimate
of where that cell is in the cell cycle, from 0 to 2pi. (Note
that we don't know what stage of the cell cycle each point in the
interval corresponds to - so there is no guarantee that 0 is the
"start" of the cell cycle. Also, because of the way these data were created we don't know which direction the cell cycle is going - it could be forward or backward.) Then there are 10 columns corresponding
to 10 different genes.

I'm going to order the rows by cell cycle (theta, first column) as this will make
things much easier later.
```{r}
# order the data
o = order(d[,1])
d = d[o,]
plot(d$theta)
```

Here we just plot 8 genes to get a sense for the data:
```{r}
par(mfcol=c(2,2))
for(i in 1:4){
  plot(d$theta, d[,(i+1)],pch=".",ylab="gene expression",xlab="cell cycle location")
}
par(mfcol=c(2,2))
for(i in 1:4){
  plot(d$theta, d[,(i+5)],pch=".",ylab="gene expression",xlab="cell cycle location")
}
```

The question we want to answer is this: which genes show greatest
evidence for varying in their expression through the cell cycle?
For now what we really want is a filter we can apply to a large
number of genes to pick out the ones that look most "interesting".
Later we might want a more formal statistical measure of evidence.

Our current idea is to try "smoothing" these data, and pick out genes
where the change in the mean over theta is most variable (in some sense).
The extreme would be if the smoother fits
a horizontal line - that indicates no variability with theta, so those genes are not interesting
to us.

# Trend filtering

Here we will apply trend filtering to smooth these data. Trend filtering,
at its simplest, applies L1 regularization to the changes in mean from one observation to the next.
(The extreme would be no changes in any of these means, so a flat line.)
It is implemented in the "genlasso" package.

```{r}
d2.tf = trendfilter(d[,2],ord = 1)
d2.tf.cv = cv.trendfilter(d2.tf) # performs 5-fold CV
plot(d[,1],d[,2],xlab="cell cycle",ylab="expression")
lines(d[,1],predict(d2.tf, d2.tf.cv$lambda.min)$fit,col=2,lwd=3)
```

This fit is a bit on the "spiky" side in places.
We can get a smoother fit by using a higher order filter. The details
are too much to include here, but basically instead of shrinking first
order differences it shrinks things that also measure differences with neighbors
a bit further apart (2nd order).
```{r}
d2.tf2 = trendfilter(d[,2],ord = 2)
d2.tf2.cv = cv.trendfilter(d2.tf2) # performs 5-fold CV
plot(d[,1],d[,2],xlab="cell cycle",ylab="expression")
lines(d[,1],predict(d2.tf, d2.tf.cv$lambda.min)$fit,col=2,lwd=3)
lines(d[,1],predict(d2.tf2, d2.tf2.cv$lambda.min)$fit,col=3,lwd=3)
```

And here we try another gene that maybe shows less evidence for variability.
```{r}
d7.tf2 = trendfilter(d[,7],ord = 2)
d7.tf2.cv = cv.trendfilter(d7.tf2) # performs 5-fold CV
plot(d[,1],d[,7],xlab="cell cycle",ylab="expression")
lines(d[,1],predict(d7.tf2, d7.tf2.cv$lambda.min)$fit,col=3,lwd=3)
```

## Dealing with the circularity

Because the $x$ axis here is cyclical, the value of $E(Y|x)$ near
$x=0$ should be similar to the value near $x=2pi$. But
trend filtering does not know this. We can encourage this behaviour
by duplicating the data using a translation. (Note this is
different than reflecting it about the boundaries).

Here is an example:

```{r}
yy = c(d[,2],d[,2],d[,2]) ## duplicated data
xx = c(d[,1]-2*pi, d[,1], d[,1]+2*pi) # shifted/translated x coordinates

yy.tf2 = trendfilter(yy,ord = 2)
yy.tf2.cv = cv.trendfilter(yy.tf2) # performs 5-fold CV
plot(xx,yy,xlab="cell cycle",ylab="expression")
lines(xx,predict(yy.tf2, yy.tf2.cv$lambda.min)$fit,col=3,lwd=3)

# plot only a single version of data
include = c(rep(FALSE,length(d[,2])), rep(TRUE, length(d[,2])), rep(FALSE, length(d[,2])))
plot(xx[include],yy[include],xlab="cell cycle",ylab="expression", main="trend filtering with circular fit")
lines(xx[include],predict(yy.tf2, yy.tf2.cv$lambda.min)$fit[include],col=3,lwd=3)

```


# Wavelets 

Here we will apply wavelets to smooth these data.

To apply wavelets we need the data to be a power of 2.
Also we need the data to be ordered in terms of theta.
We'll subset the data to 512 elements here, and order it:
```{r}
# subset the data
set.seed(1)
subset = sort(sample(1:nrow(d),512,replace=FALSE))
d.sub = d[subset,]
```


Here we do the Haar wavelet by specifying `family="DaubExPhase",filter.number = 1` to the discrete wavelet 
transform function `wd`. The plot shows the wavelet transformed
values, separately at each resolution.
```{r}
wds <- wd(d.sub[,2],family="DaubExPhase",filter.number = 1)
plot(wds)
```

To illustrate the idea behind wavelet shrinkage we use
the policy "manual" to shrink all the high-resolution coefficients 
(levels 4-8) to 0. 
```{r}
wtd <- threshold(wds, levels = 4:8,  policy="manual",value = 99999) 
plot(wtd) 
```

Now undo the wavelet transform on the shrunken coefficients
```{r}
fd <- wr(wtd) #reconstruct
plot(d.sub$theta,d.sub[,2],xlab="cell cycle", ylab = "Expression")
lines(d.sub$theta,fd,col=2,lwd=3)
```


The estimate here is a bit "jumpy", due to the use of the Haar wavelet and the rather naive hard thresholding. We can make it less "jumpy"
by using a "less step-wise" wavelet basis
```{r}
wds <- wd(d.sub[,2],family="DaubLeAsymm",filter.number = 8)
wtd <- threshold(wds, levels = 4:8,  policy="manual",value = 99999) 
fd <- wr(wtd) #reconstruct
plot(d.sub$theta,d.sub[,2],xlab="cell cycle", ylab = "Expression")
lines(d.sub$theta,fd,col=2,lwd=3)
```

What happens if we use an Empirical Bayes thresholding rule?

The `smashr` package [described here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07787) 
essentially does wavelet smoothing by Empirical Bayes. The prior
is a mixture of normals, with different priors at different wavelet resolutions.

Notice that the outliers cause "problems"
```{r}
library("smashr")
smash.res = smash(d.sub[,2])
plot(d.sub$theta,d.sub[,2],xlab="cell cycle", ylab = "Expression")
lines(d.sub$theta,smash.res,col=2,lwd=3)
```

Here we removed the outliers (actually setting them to the mean) to avoid this problem:
```{r}
xx = ifelse(d.sub[,2]<2,mean(d.sub[,2]),d.sub[,2])
smash.res = smash(xx)
plot(d.sub$theta,d.sub[,2],xlab="cell cycle", ylab = "Expression")
lines(d.sub$theta,smash.res,col=2,lwd=3)
```



## Dealing with the circularity

Note that the default in `smashr` is to assume
the data are periodic on their region of definition - that is, circular.
So we don't have to do anything special here. It is taken care of!
